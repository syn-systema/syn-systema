👋 Hello, I'm CS,

🧠 I am a multidisciplinary researcher specializing in the integration of pure mathematical frameworks within artificial intelligence and systems biology operations research. My expertise encompasses category theory, graph theory, automata theory, and abstract algebra, where I focus on developing abstract mathematical models and innovative meta-frameworks driven by intuitive operations.

🖥️ Currently, I am immersed in the NVIDIA development environment, investigating its potential applications in the energy sector. My research delves into the intricate connections between graph theory, network theory, automata theory, information theory, and cognitive architectures, with a particular interest in narrative networks.

🧬 I am also passionate about advancing systems biology through the design of complex systems that align with its principles. My aspiration is to create organic xenobot systems that seamlessly integrate biological insights with cutting-edge computational models.

🔍 I thrive on exploring unconventional methodologies to address complex challenges, aiming to bridge disciplinary gaps for groundbreaking insights. I am keen on collaborative projects that intersect automata theory, category theory, graph theory, and linguistic theory, particularly in areas involving prompt engineering.
